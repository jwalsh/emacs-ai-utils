#+TITLE: Emacs AI Utilities

Emacs AI Utilities is a package that provides a set of interactive functions and utilities to enhance the interaction between Emacs and AI-based systems. It includes functions for data manipulation, machine learning, and natural language processing.

* Features

  - Buffer Size Limiting: Functions to limit buffer size to avoid exceeding ChatGPT maximum submission size (`ai-utils-limit-buffer-size`, `ai-utils-copy-to-kill-ring`).

  - AI Block Insertion: Functions to insert empty AI blocks into documents (`ai-utils-insert-ai`, `ai-utils-insert-ai-image`).

  - Prompt Generation: Functions to generate various prompts for shell scripts, Python simulations, and literary-style writing (`ai-utils-insert-prompt-shell-script`, `ai-utils-insert-prompt-python-simulator`, `ai-utils-insert-prompt-social-media-post-sartre`, `ai-utils-insert-prompt-social-media-post-joyce`).

* Usage

  Functions can be invoked interactively in Emacs. For example:
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (ai-utils-insert-ai)
  #+END_SRC

* Customization

  The package provides a customization group (`ai-utils`) and a customizable variable (`ai-utils-max-prompt-size`) to configure the maximum number of characters allowed in a ChatGPT prompt.

* Future Enhancements

  - Additional AI Utilities: We plan to expand the package with more utilities for AI interaction, such as natural language processing and machine learning tools.

  - Enhanced AI Block Support: We aim to provide more options and features for AI blocks, such as image generation and customization.
